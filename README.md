# jenkins job builder example files

these are basic jjb example files to get you started.

They show you how to create a couple of example jenkins job builder jobs with:

* `post-build downstream depencies`
* including `scripts` in your jjb jobs
* leveraging docker, jenkins, tox

Plus you get to play around with some fun ci/devops tools
