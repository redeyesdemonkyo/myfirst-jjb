# jenkins job builder example files

these are basic jjb jobs example files to get you from ZERO to HERO in JJB.

They show you how to create a couple of example jenkins job builder jobs with:

* `post-build downstream depencies`
* including `scripts` in your jjb jobs
* leveraging docker, jenkins, tox

Plus you get to play around with some fun ci/devops tools

Check out `docs/README.md` for full tutorial.
